OVERVIEW

This project contains 3 parts:
1. src/api/ (Back-end) - contains the restful APIs for my app.
I created my own little framework for back-end to brush up my skills in PHP and MySQL.

Language: PHP, MySQL

2. src/spa/ (Front-end) - contains my single page application. 
I used a free Bootstrap template and integrated it with AngularJS.

Framework: AngularJS, Bootstrap

3. src/scripts/ - this contains the DB script

Instructions on how to run the App is in src/NOTES.md
